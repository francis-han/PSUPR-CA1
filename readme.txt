## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT
This Program is for the testing of Single Semiconductor Memory Chip
In Memory Chip testing, a number of electronic tests are conducted using the programmable automatic electronic tester.
Electronic testing is used not only to sort out chip failures, its results can also be used to find out the locations of failure inside the array. This will then help to identify the root cause of the failures. For example, the source of the failure could be due to the lithography process prior to the chip testing.
A DRAM chip uses row and column to indicate the array cell position. Hence, it is important to understand whether the failures is coming from the row, column, or individual cell (or combination).
